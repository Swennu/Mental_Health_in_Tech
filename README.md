# Mental_Health_in_Tech
## Svend Sakkool, Tambet Osman
The main goal is to combine data exploration, pattern discovery, and predictive modeling to understand and forecast mental health treatment-seeking behavior among tech employees, producing insights that are both analytically rigorous and socially meaningful.
## Models
The predictive model is in a jupiter notebook [models.ipynb](https://github.com/Swennu/Mental_Health_in_Tech/blob/main/model.py). Use this to replicate the results of our project.
## Data
The data is stored in [/data](https://github.com/Swennu/Mental_Health_in_Tech/tree/main/Data) folder. There are 2 files. The original survey.csv and the one we modified data_cleaned.csv. There also is [data_cleaning.py](https://github.com/Swennu/Mental_Health_in_Tech/blob/main/Data_cleaning.py), it contains all the code for cleaning the survey data. To run it use [main.py](https://github.com/Swennu/Mental_Health_in_Tech/blob/main/main.py). Last file related to data is [Controlling_data.py](https://github.com/Swennu/Mental_Health_in_Tech/blob/main/Controlling_data.py) It is just used to see all the unique values of the dataset.
Our predictive models used the data_cleaned.csv
